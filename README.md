## Comments

- Wanted to try something besides day/momentjs so opted for a random colour generator.
  - The biggest issue was attempting to make the site title a random colour each time a page loaded, but instead, a random colour is static until the server is reset
  - While not dynamic, I think it fulfills the custom module requirement? (You can see it inserted on *line 3* of `header.ejs`)
- Gallery output is on the *Coming Soon* page.
- Registration page is only linked on the *Login* page to avoid cluttering the nav bar.
- `<head></head>` is omitted from the `head.ejs` partial because certain stylesheets and scripts are unique to a single page and had to be tuck them in with the partial.
- 404 page was plucked from last assignment and therefore isn't styled -- sorry!
